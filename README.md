This project is an interactive quiz site built for students working through the set of math workbooks called HELM (Helping Engineers Learn Mathematics). It aims to provide an engaging way for students to test their knowledge and understanding of mathematical concepts covered in the HELM workbooks. The quiz is designed to render math equations and vectors effectively and assess the correctness of students' answers.

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Eleventy, MathJax, and Math.js.
